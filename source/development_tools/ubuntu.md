### Dual Booting

If you want to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows, you can follow the [official guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

### Boot Loader

[reFind](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a boot manager for UEFI and BIOS systems. It can be used to manage multiple operating systems and provide a graphical interface for selecting the OS to boot.

Just install it on your system and it will automatically detect all installed operating systems. You can customize the boot menu and add custom entries for your operating systems.

reFind supports custom themes, allowing you to change the appearance of the boot menu. You can find a collection of themes under the [refind-theme GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/refind-theme).
